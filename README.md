**Lab Report: Rule-Based NLP and Regex for Bill Generation**

**Objective:**
The main aim of this lab was to gain proficiency in Rule-Based Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Regular Expressions (Regex), fundamental techniques in the field of Natural Language Processing. The lab also provided an introduction to Word Embeddings, another essential concept in NLP.

**Work Done:**

**Part 1: Rule-Based NLP and Regex:**
In this section of the lab, we focused on implementing a Python program using Regex to generate a bill from a given text input provided by the user. The objective was to extract relevant information such as product names, quantities, and prices from the input text using Regex patterns.

**Use Case:**
For the practical exercise, we were given a sample text input: "I bought three Samsung smartphones 150 $ each, four kilos of fresh banana for 1,2 dollar a kilogram, and one Hamburger with 4,5 dollar." Our task was to develop a Python script that could parse this text and generate a bill with the following details:

**Generated Bill:**
 - **Product** **Quantity** **Unit Price** **Total Price**   
-Samsung smartphone 3        5                15

**Challenges Faced:**
- Identifying and constructing appropriate Regex patterns to accurately extract product information from the text.
- Handling variations in numeric representations (e.g., numbers written out as words or containing commas for thousands separators).
- Ensuring robustness of the script to handle different formats and structures of input text.

**Conclusion:**
The lab provided valuable hands-on experience in applying Rule-Based NLP techniques and Regex for information extraction tasks. By completing this exercise, we gained a deeper understanding of how to leverage Regex patterns to parse and extract structured data from unstructured text, a skill that is essential in many NLP applications. Overall, the lab successfully achieved its objective of familiarizing us with Rule-Based NLP and Regex concepts in a practical context.

**Future Work:**
- Further refining the Regex patterns to handle more complex text inputs and edge cases.
- Exploring advanced techniques such as Named Entity Recognition (NER) for more accurate extraction of product names and quantities.
- Integrating additional features such as error handling and user interaction to enhance the usability of the bill generation system.
